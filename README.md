# Jackrabbit

Jackrabbit is my hackathon project at [TeenHacks](http://teenhacks.org/).

Unfortunatly, my hackathon project did not win because it was too generic. I was playing it too safe at my `first` hackathon and I was working alone. I didn't want to take any chances with a crazy hack idea or anything. I underestimated my abilities and at the same time didn't realized how much time I had during the hackathon. I should have spent more time planning and looking for other teammates.

Somehow only one of the judges came to judge my project. I felt this judge absolutely crush my soul. He stated, "WTF?! Is this this piece of shit? This is a horrible hackathon project idea. There is already a bunch of other blogging platform out there. This idea sucks. If you were working for me, I would have fire you." I was devastated when he said that. But of course, being down and depressed because of this statement isn't going to help anybody. What can I do better next time? It is simple, get a fucking better hackathon project idea. But sadly, I don't think I'm that creative of a person. I'm more a of a reliability developer. Making sure everything is working and the project is maintable and scalable.
